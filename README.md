# Histogram-Modifications
**Project Title: Image Histogram Modification**

**Description:**

The main aim of this assignment is to experiment with histogram modification approaches and observe their effects on images. In detail, given an input image, the contrast of the image is evaluated initially. Then, three approaches (contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and grayscale transformation) are performed on the input image, resulting in three outputs. Finally, the contrast is re-evaluated for each of the three outputs. The following components are to be implemented:

1. **Co-occurrence Matrix and Contrast Calculation**: Implement the calculation of the co-occurrence matrix and compute the contrast of the image.

2. **Calculate Histograms**:
   - **Image Histogram**: Calculate the histogram of the input image.
   - **Cumulative Histogram**: Compute the cumulative histogram of the input image.
   - **Color Covering Percentage**: Determine the percentage of colors covered in the image.

3. **Modify Histogram**:
   - **Contrast Stretching**: Perform contrast stretching on the input image to enhance its contrast.
   - **Histogram Equalization**: Apply histogram equalization to the input image to improve its overall contrast.
   - **Grayscale Transformation**: Transform the input image to grayscale, altering its appearance and potentially its contrast.

**Requirements:**

- Implement the co-occurrence matrix calculation and contrast evaluation.
- Develop functions to compute the image histogram, cumulative histogram, and color covering percentage.
- Implement histogram modification techniques including contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and grayscale transformation.
- Provide clear documentation and comments for code clarity and understanding.
- Test the implemented components thoroughly to ensure correctness and effectiveness.
- Consider handling edge cases and exceptional scenarios gracefully.

**Expected Output:**

- Implementation details of each component with explanations.
- Test cases and results demonstrating the effectiveness of histogram modification techniques.
- Visual representations (e.g., graphs, images) showing the changes in contrast before and after applying each modification.
- Discussion on the impact of each histogram modification technique on image contrast and quality.

**Additional Notes:**

- Experiment with different parameters and settings for each histogram modification technique to observe their effects.
- Encourage collaboration and contributions from others interested in image processing and computer vision.
- Consider exploring real-world applications and scenarios where these histogram modification techniques can be beneficial.
